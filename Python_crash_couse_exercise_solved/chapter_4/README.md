# Python Exercises - Book Chapter 4

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Python exercises. Here, I practice and share code snippets from my journey through a Python book. Each script is organized by exercise number and includes tasks that improve basic Python skills like list operations, loops, and comprehensions.

## Table of Contents
1. [4.1 Pizzas](#41-pizzas)
2. [4.2 Animals](#42-animals)
3. [4.3 Counting to Twenty](#43-counting-to-twenty)
4. [4.4 One Million](#44-one-million)
5. [4.5 Summing a Million](#45-summing-a-million)
6. [4.6 Odd Numbers](#46-odd-numbers)
7. [4.7 Threes](#47-threes)
8. [4.8 & 4.9 Cubes](#48--49-cubes--cube-comprehension)

### 4.1 Pizzas
The program iterates over a list of favorite pizzas and prints statements about each one.

### 4.2 Animals
This script lists animals suitable for Eid, and each animal is described in terms of its usefulness.

### 4.3 Counting to Twenty
A simple loop to print numbers from 1 to 20.

### 4.4 One Million
Generates a list of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000. This demonstrates the use of Python’s range function and how to handle large sequences (commented out to prevent excessive output).

### 4.5 Summing a Million
Finds the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list containing numbers from 1 to 1,000,000. This is useful for learning list aggregation functions.

### 4.6 Odd Numbers
Prints all odd numbers between 1 and 20. This exercise shows how to use `range()` with a step argument to skip numbers.

### 4.7 Threes
Creates a list of the first ten multiples of 3, then prints each item. A simple use of list comprehension and looping.

### 4.8 & 4.9 Cubes
Generates a list of the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10, then prints each item. This demonstrates basic list comprehension and exponentiation.

### 4.10 Slices
Displays slices of a list containing cubes. Shows the first three items, three middle items, and three last items of the list, illustrating Python’s slicing capabilities.

### 4.11 My Pizzas, Your Pizzas
Copies a list of favorite pizzas, adds unique pizzas to each list, and then prints each list to show how lists can be independently modified even after copying.

### 4.13 Buffet
Defines a tuple of food items available at a buffet, prints each item, and then redefines the tuple to show how tuples (immutable sequences) can be re-assigned.

### Getting Started
To run these exercises, you need Python 3 installed. Each script is standalone, so you can run them individually by executing `python filename.py` in your terminal.
